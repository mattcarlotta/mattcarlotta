## About me

Up until 2012 I used to be a commercial artist, but in 2016 I began a long and arduous journey to become a fullstack developer who is passionate about open-source projects, helping the web development community, and building kick-ass, SEO optimized apps. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Mongo/PostgreSQL, ReactJS, Redux, NextJS, ExpressJS, and NodeJS. Recently, I've being teaching myself Typescript and delving into the world of Next's static site generators.
