In 2016, I changed my career from commercial art to fullstack software engineering. Since then, I have specialized in using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Express, React w/ Redux, and Node to build apps that are test-driven, data-driven, cross-platform, and production-ready. From time to time, I'll also tinker with Shell script, Rust, Go, and C++. Just as important to what I use, I'm a huge proponent for building web accessible apps that adhere to the <a title="opens in a new window" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  WCAG AA/AAA Standards.
