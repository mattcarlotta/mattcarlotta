## [My Toolbelt](https://macar.dev/background/#tech-specs)

In September 2016, I transitioned away from an art career to become a fullstack software engineer. As the years have gone by, I have 
focused my efforts in: MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS/ReduxJS and NodeJS.

The apps I build are test-driven, data-driven, cross-platform, and production-ready. I also deploy and maintain them on remote headless Linux servers. Most importantly, I'm a huge proponent for building web accessible applications that adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA/AAA standards.

Outside of work, I love walking my dog Nico, building my own desktop computers and watching sci-fi/mystery/thriller movies. In my free time, I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects. I enjoy engaging with the web development community by asking & answering questions on various platforms Stackoverflow, Codesandbox and Github discussions.
